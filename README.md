We observed South has the highest sales by region at 927,820, followed by East at 485,925, next is North at 387,000 and the last region being West at 300,345.

Monthly sale as February as month with the highest sales in both year 2023 and 2024, while  April experienced low sales in both years.

## Recommendations
---
Following the above findings, we will recommend that the company or store should ensure that they are enouugh stock to sell in February so they do not run out of suppply since this month appears to be the highest for both year.

We recommend, that an investigation be done to findout reason for poor sales in April as this is constant in both years.

South has the highest sales, aking i the cash cow of the company. As such, we recommend more resources should be put in place to keep this rate at maximum in that region while we probe on the reason for the low sales in the Western region.
